[[ixni]] uses the particle [[li]] to separate context from the sentence that context affects. The context sentence always sits before [[li]]. Here's a schema of how [[li]] works:
X [[li]] Y can be translated like 
- Y is true if X is true
- Y is true when X is true
- in the context of X, Y
In addition to that, you can add time words ([[oj]], [[oh]], [[om]]) to indicate the time of Y in relation to X.
X [[li]][[oj]] Y - Y happens before X
X [[li]][[oh]] Y - Y happens during X
X [[li]][[om]] Y - Y happens after X
[[li]][[oh]] in most cases is redundant in the same way as verb[[oh]] is. Also, times can be chained with [[li]] (check [[time and tense in ixni]]). For example, X [[li]][[om]][[oh]] Y would mean something like "Y happens just after X".
