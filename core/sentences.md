# word order
Sentences in [[ixni]] have the object-subject-verb (OSV) word order. The word order never changes.
Describer words (like adjectives) always come before the word they're describing. For example [[nab]] [[xot]] [[to]] [[je]] would mean "this is a blue cat". Other example is [[to]] [[jer]] [[by]] [[jab]] [[pana]][[or]] meaning "give me this". Notice how [[by]] [[jer]] describes the recipient.
# questions
The -[[ka]] suffix turns the sentence into a question about the word it's attached to. For example, [[xto]][[ka]] [[to]] [[je]] would mean "what is this" with a higher importance put on [[xto]]. You can't make a sentence without the -[[ka]] suffix. [[xto]] [[to]] [[je]] would roughly translate to "this is what" and wouldn't make sense. Another example of the -[[ka]] suffix is yes or no questions. If you put -[[ka]] on any non-[[wh]] word, the sentence will turn into a question about that word.
Examples of yes/no questions:
- [[xot]][[ka]] [[jon]] [[je]]? - "is it a cat?"
- [[to]] [[jer]][[ka]] [[je]]? - "is it you who this is?"
- [[to]] [[jer]] [[wyxotar]][[ka]]? - "are you doing this?"
# imperatives
Imperative sentences are formed with the -[[or]] suffix. You can only put it onto a verb. You can make single word imperative sentences (for example, [[wyxotar]][[or]] means "do"), but if you want to make it more complex (like add an object), you have to make a whole sentence. [[to]] [[wyxotar]][[or]] instead of meaning "do this", would mean "do" and be addressed at *to*. The correct way of saying "do this" would be [[to]] [[jer]] [[wyxotar]][[or]].
# sentence nesting
[[ixni]] has a unique feature called "sentence nesting". What it means is that you can put a sentence into another sentence. If you want to say that you want to do something, you just put what you want to happen in a nested sentence. For example [[ixni]] [[jab]] [[wyfoma]] [[jab]] [[hexy]] would mean "i want to speak ixni" but more literally, it would be translated as "i want this to be true: i speak ixni".
