[[wh]] words are special words that when making a question about them, instead of making a yes/no question, they make a wh question.
Those words are 
- [[xto]]
- [[wer]]
- [[jak]]
- [[wen]]
Here's an example of how it works: [[xto]][[ka]] [[to]] [[je]] instead of meaning "is this *what*?" means "what is this?".
