In [[ixni]], tense is expressed through the use of three distinct suffixes:

- [[oj]] indicates past tense.
- [[oh]] denotes present tense.
- [[om]] signifies future tense.

For a more nuanced expression of time, these tense markers can be combined in a sequential manner. For instance, the combination [[wyxotar]][[oj]][[oh]] can be understood as "just finished doing". It's essential to note that the chaining of tenses follows a left-to-right order.

To specify a particular day, employ the "-[[e]] [[dizen]]" construction. For example, [[oh]][[e]] [[dizen]] means today.
