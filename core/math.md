# expressing numbers 
numbers are described through a system that emphasizes place value. to express a number like 24, you would begin by stating the multiple of ten, in this case, "[[dyw]] [[cejn]][[ei]]" followed by the units, joined together using [[are]], "[[are]] [[xyt]]", giving us "[[dyw]] [[cejn]][[ei]] [[are]] [[xyt]]"
# ordinal numbers
ordinal numbers are formed by adding the -[[e]] suffix to numbers (like [[heks]][[e]])
