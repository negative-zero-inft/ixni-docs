the ixni vocabulary was mainly derived from altered versions of words from:
- english
- polish
- russian
- ukrainian 
- german
- toki pona
- older [[NRD]] conlangs

aldo it does have it's fair share of original words, and even the ones borrowed from other languages have had their meaning altered or merged with other words making some words have many translations depending on context, but they're still logically connected in such a way that it's easy to guess what they mean.
