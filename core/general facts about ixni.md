technically, the beginning of ixni can be traced back to when [[NRD]] was bored at school and made some vocabulary and an alphabet. it barely looks like current ixni though. for example [[nehr]] used to be "nahr" and instead of questions using the [[ka]] suffix, they'd reverse the word order. for example "[[to]] [[jer]] [[zynax]]” would turn into ”[[zynax]] [[jer]] [[to]]?"

[[ixni]] originated as [[chickian]].

The second [[ixni]] speaker (just after its creator, [[NRD]]) is [[CNB]].
